### Private DNS Zone

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike other resources, **Private DNS Zone** is "**Global**".

#### Market place

Look for a "Private DNS Zone" in the Azure Portal's market place

##### Basics

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All Storage containers will get registered under `{name}.blob.core.windows.net`

But when we create a **Private DNS Zone**, storage accounts also get registered under the `privatelink` you create. as an alias: `{name}.{dns_zone_name}.blob.core.windows.net`

- **Name**: `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`

##### Virtual Network Links

We'll create Virtual Network Links for `hub` and `spoke` VNets.

1. Go to "DNS Management" > "Virtual Network Links".
1. Click on **[ + Add ]** and select the VNet to link.

###### VNet: Hub

![Link to Hub VNet](../../../../assets/img/azure/solution/vnets/hub/pdnsz/st/dns_management/virtual_network_links/hub.png)

**Virtual network details**

- **Link name**: Give a meaningful name to the link, like `privatelink-at-hub`
- **Virtual Network**: Select the **Hub** VNet

**Configuration**

- [ ] **Enable auto registration**: Leave this unchecked.
- [ ] **Enable fallback to the internet**: Leave this unchecked.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!TIP]
> **Auto-registration** Is only used when you have VM scalesets or other services that need to register themselves.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

###### VNet: Spoke

![Link to Spoke VNet](../../../../assets/img/azure/solution/vnets/hub/pdnsz/st/dns_management/virtual_network_links/spoke.png)

**Virtual network details**

- **Link name**: Give a meaningful name to the link, like `privatelink-at-spoke`
- **Virtual Network**: Select the **Spoke** VNet

**Configuration**

- [ ] **Enable auto registration**: Leave this unchecked.
- [ ] **Enable fallback to the internet**: Leave this unchecked.

## Status Check
