###### Administrator account

Create a username and password you'll remember. If you forget it, you might need to completely recreate the VM.

##### Disks

![Disks](../../../../assets/img/hub/vm/create/disks.png)

- [x] **Delete with VM**: Checked
- **Key management**: _"Platform-managed key"_

##### Networking

###### Network interface

We'll just go ahead and put it in our `default` subnet (1 IP address down, 1,023 left).

![Networking](../../../../assets/img/hub/vm/create/networking.png)

- **Public IP**: _"None"_ .- **VERY IMPORTANT**. We'll access via Bastion's Public IP address
- **NIC network security group**: _"Advanced"_
- **Configure network security group**: You can use the NSG we created for all the Hub's `default` `subnet`, or create a new one specific for this VM if you need more level of control.
- [x] **Delete NIC when VM is deleted**: Checked
- **Subnet**: `default`. Note that the other 2 **delegated subnets**, are listed, but not available for selection.

##### Review + Create

Take a good look at the TERMS

#### Checkpoint

Note that some names will be auto-generated with randomized characters.
If you want to avoid this, you would need to create those resources manually and then attaching them.
