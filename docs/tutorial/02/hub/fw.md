# Configuring Azure Firewall

Now that all traffic is going through the **Azure Firewall**, we can start adding rules to allow or deny traffic.

> [!TIP]
> Everytime you add a rule, the firewall takes like 1+ full minute(s) to apply the rule.

We're going to add **Network Rules Collection**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Rules (Classic)**
1. Go to second tab **Network Rules Collection**
1. Click on **+ Add network rule collection**

## Pre-requisites: DNS Proxy

### Step 1: Try to add any FDQN rule

Try to add an allow rule.

- Name: `allow-github`
- Priority: `100`
- Action: _"Allow"_
- Rules
  - FQDNS:

| name           | Protocol | Source Type | Source | Destination FQDNs | Destination Ports |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `GitHub.com`   | Any      | Any         | `*`    | `Github.com`      | `*`               |
| `*.GitHub.com` | Any      | Any         | `*`    | `*.GitHub.com`    | `*`               |

> [!TIP]
> Domain are case-insensitive

You should get a couple of errors

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!CRITICAL]
> * is not allowed

> [!CRITICAL]
> You must enable DNS Proxy
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Proceed to next section

### Step 2: Enable DNS Proxy

Uhm, it seems we missed something...

![DNS Proxy must be enabled](../../../../assets/img/azure/solution/vnets/hub/fw/rules/allow-github-disallowed.png)

Oh, so we need to enable the **DNS Proxy** first!

1. Navigate do DNS

- [x] Mark "DNS Settings" as "Enabled"
- [x] Mark "DNS Proxy" as Enabled

![Enable DNS Proxy](../../../../assets/img/azure/solution/vnets/hub/fw/dns/proxy/disabled.png)

Now try to go back to the rules and add the rule again.

> [!NOTE]
> DNS Proxy works on port `53`.

You should take this into account, when securing Network Security Groups

## Step 3: Add the FDQN rule

Now try again to add the `allow` rule mentioned above.

- Name: `allow-github`
- Priority: `100`
- Action: _"Allow"_
- Rules
  - FQDNS:

| name         | Protocol | Source Type | Source | Destination FQDNs | Destination Ports |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `GitHub.com` | Any      | Any         | `*`    | `GitHub.com`      | `*`               |

## Scenarios

There are 2 scenarios we can consider:

1. **Allow all, except...**: (5 minutes-ish) If you don't have much time to spend, this is the quickest way to get started to understand some concepts.
1. **Zero Trust.- Disallow ALL, except...**: (30 minutes-ish) If you want to learn more and are willing to put in the time, head to the second scenario

Either way, we recommend that you fully read both before you proceed, so you have a better understanding of trade-offs.

_"In politics, there are no solutions, only trade-offs."_

### Scenario 1: Allow All, except...

![meme](../../../../assets/img/memes/lazy-security.gif)

In the most basic scenario, we can

1. Assume `allow` **all traffic** by default (no additional rule needed)
1. And then manage a disallow list were we add things we DON'T want.

Do you know how time consuming it could be to basically keep an inventory of all the WWW?

Who wants that kind of headache? Any who...

#### Step 1: Check access

1. Open Edge browser
1. Navigate to [https://google.com](https://google.com)
1. See that the site is correctly rendered

We want to make sure that it was the firewall that did the blocking, and not some miss-vm-configuration.

#### Step 2: Disallow google.com

- Name: `disallow-google`
- Priority: `1000`
- Action: _"Deny"_
- Rules
  - FQDNS:

| name         | Protocol | Source Type | Source | Destination FQDNs | Destination Ports |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `google.com` | Any      | Any         | `*`    | `google.com`      | `*`               |

Now go to the Jump box.

You might still be able to access `google.com` because of the DNS cache.
How so?

1. `google.com` redirects to `www.google.com`
1. But we're only blocking contents of `google.com`

Oh jeez!

#### Step 3: Disallow www.google.com

Well, let's add a rule for `*.google.com` then.

| name           | Protocol | Source Type | Source | Destination FQDNs | Destination Ports |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `*.google.com` | Any      | Any         | `*`    | `*.google.com`    | `*`               |

_"What do you mean I cannot add `*.foo.bar` domains?"_

Alright, let's try `www.google.com` then.

| name             | Protocol | Source Type | Source | Destination FQDNs | Destination Ports |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `www.google.com` | Any      | Any         | `*`    | `www.google.com`  | `*`               |

So your rule should look like this:

- Name: `disallow-google`
- Priority: `1000`
- Action: _"Deny"_
- Rules
  - FQDNS:

| name             | Protocol | Source Type | Source | Destination FQDNs | Destination Ports |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `google.com`     | Any      | Any         | `*`    | `google.com`      | `*`               |
| `www.google.com` | Any      | Any         | `*`    | `www.google.com`  | `*`               |

_"Are there any domains I have not accounted for?"_

Well, Yeah! like THE REST OF THE INTERNET! (Why are we screaming?!)

### Scenario 2: Zero Trust.- Disallow ALL, except...

#### Step 1: Disallow all

Add a rule to disallow all traffic.

- Name: `disallow-all`
- Priority: `64000`
- Action: _"Deny"_
- Rules
  - IP Addresses:

| name  | Protocol | Source Type | Source | Destination Type | Destination Addresses | Destination Ports |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| `Any` | Any      | Any         | `*`    | Any              | `*`                   | `*`               |

Now go to the Jump box, and test that in fact you cannot access anything in the WWW, like `bing.com`

![Deny all](../../../../assets/img/azure/solution/vnets/hub/vm/inside/com/bing/01.png)

#### Step 2: Add MORE FQDNs

Yai! \o/
err... success?

![github.com](../../../../assets/img/azure/solution/vnets/hub/vm/inside/com/github/01.png)

Great... Seems that we're able to load **some** `GitHub.com` resources.

If we inspect with Developer tools with <kbd>F11</kbd>, we can see OTHER domains, like `GitHub.GithubAssets.com`.

So keep rinse & repeat until:

- `a)` You're proven youself a point and your learning ego is satisfied and ready to move on.
- or `b)` Your OCD is happy to see the page fully rendered!

`GitHub.com`
![github.com](../../../../assets/img/azure/solution/vnets/hub/vm/inside/com/github/02.png)

`bing.com`
![github.com](../../../../assets/img/azure/solution/vnets/hub/vm/inside/com/bing/02.png)

##### Rules

These are all the rules we ended up adding:

![rules](../../../../assets/img/azure/solution/vnets/hub/fw/rules/n.png)

**Zero Trust** can sure be exhausting!

But hey, you're worth it!
