## Architecture

This diagram is an oversimpification of what we've built so far. But it paints a picture of what we're trying to achieve.-

So if an external user [like yourself], wants to access a private resource from one of the private spoke-VNets (like a webapp, or a storage account), we need to use the Bastion service to proxy into the Jump box, and then access the private resource.
